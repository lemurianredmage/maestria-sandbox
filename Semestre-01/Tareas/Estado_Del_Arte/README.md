## Comparison Table of Models

|Method|Strengths|Challenges|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Siamese Network|Simple and interpretable.|May need hard negative mining.|
|Triplet Network|Robust for generalization.|Triplet generation can be expensive.|
|Metric Learning|Strong for embedding optimization.|Needs careful loss tuning.|
|Vision Transformers|Handles global relationships in images.|Computationally expensive.|
|CNN + Similarity|Pretrained models reduce training effort.|Requires effective similarity function.|
|Cross-Attention|Localized, interpretable matching.|Complexity in implementation.|
|Fine-Tuned Classifier|Straightforward binary classification.|Less flexible for generalization.|
|Local Descriptors|Lightweight, no heavy training needed.|Limited robustness to transformations.|
